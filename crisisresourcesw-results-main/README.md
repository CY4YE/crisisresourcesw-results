## Contributing

We greatly appreciate any volunteer efforts made towards expanding this vast repository of crisis resources.

To get started, clone this repository. If you cannot do that, open an issue and list the resource you would like to add.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/CY4YE/crisisresourcesw-results.git  
```

Then navigate to the file you wish to add the resource in. The directory structure for the posts is as follows:

```text
crisisresources-main/
|--- region/
     |--- Alberta/
          |--- your-file-here.html
          |--- calgary.html
     |--- British-Columbia/
     ...
```

You can either add a new region, for example say, Gatineau. If the folder `Quebec/` is not present, make the folder under the `region/` folder. Then make a file named `gatineau.html` in `Quebec/`. Then add in this [template](./regions_template.html) into the file. Then you can add your crisis resources links in Markdown. 

When you're done, make a pull request and we'll add it in.

If you're not familiar with markdown, here's a guide, or you can simply open an issue and we can add it instead.
