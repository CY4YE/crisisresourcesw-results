    The following is done in markdown, so I added the Github css styling (../../css/gfm.css) to make it look similar to Github's README files.
    So if you want to add some background colour to the tables, I think it would work if it's in ../../css/style.css

    .markdown-content table th {
        background-color: some-color!important;
